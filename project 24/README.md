## day 24    
- what?     
In today's lesson I know about file system, absolute path, relative path, how to read, write, append file, also about .replace(), .strip() and most importantly .readlines()

how .readlines() return a list of every line,
for ex:
```
['Aang\n', 'Zuko\n', 'Appa\n', 'Katara\n', 'Sokka\n', 'Momo\n', 'Uncle Iroh\n', 'Toph']
```
- .write()      
it generally overwrite on the file content, but if the file not present on the current directory it's create the particular file which is really cool

- project   
with the help of those python features i create many mails where the for every letter the person name will show like - Dear [name], ....<br>
and the file name was `letter_for_{name}.txt` If any one reading this they can find the code on the `project 23/main.py` file, I am writing this so whenever I want to what i did in the particular project I just get the view of what was the project back in the day
