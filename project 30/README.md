### Day 30 //Project 30
- Topic - Errors, Expections and Saving JSON Data

## What I learn so far?
- **ADD exception handling in nato phonetick alphabate - project 26** 
- We will add more features to our exiting website which done in password manager tkinter, like search button

- try, except, else, finally
    1. try - we put code which might generate exception, if any exception are raised it will go to the except block
    2. except - if any exception raised in try block it will catch the exception and deal with the exception
    3. else - If there is no exception raise by 'try' block, then the 'else' block will be executed.
    4. finally - no matter exception raised or not, the finally block always be executed

- Raising Own Exceptions - by using raise keyword `raise TypeError`
